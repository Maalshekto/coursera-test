        Tatsutaage is like Karaage, seasoned and deep-fried meat or fish.  Just like our Saba Tatsutaage, chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce, rolled in Katakuriko (potato starch) instead of wheat flour, and deep-fried.  Tatsutaage may be a little lighter and crispier than Karaage.

        Japanese Beef Steak is very close to western steaks except for the sauce.  The sauce is a soy sauce based sauce, a little bit like Teriyaki sauce but maybe less sweet.  Even though Japanese people typically donâ€™t eat big steaks as often as people in the US, the dish is still one of their favorites.

        This is a brilliant sushi roll with everything sushi fans love, in and on it. So what is it? Basically, prawns and avocado on the inside, with both salmon and tuna on the outside, topped with ikura for the looks and flavor.
